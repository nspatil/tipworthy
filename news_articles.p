V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe jacket which Elvis Presley wore in the film ''Viva Las Vegas'' during his legendary dance scene with Ann-Margret, expected to go for an estimated $30,000 to $50,000 at auction, is seen in a photo provided by Elvis Presley Enterprises in Memphis, Tennessee August 13,...\u000aReuters/Elvis Presley Enterprises/Handout\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aNASHVILLE, Tenn. An auction at Elvis Presley's Graceland mansion showed the King of Rock 'n' Roll remains as popular in death as he was in life.\u000a\u000aAbout 150 bidders attended and thousands more participated online in the auction, which ended late on Thursday and generated nearly $1 million.\u000a\u000aThey bid on 160 items belonging to the late singer, including a gold-and-diamond necklace with the letters "TCB" - meaning "taking care of business" - that was a gift from fellow Las Vegas entertainer Sammy Davis Jr.\u000a\u000aThe necklace fetched $40,000, well above the pre-sale estimated value of $20,000 to $30,000, while a racquetball shirt Presley wore to play on his private court sold for $32,500, easily topping the estimated value of $4,000 to $6,000.\u000a\u000aAlso selling for $32,500 was a 1960s jacket and leather pants ensemble that was estimated before the auction to be worth up to $8,000.\u000a\u000a"There were some nice surprises ... and we were thrilled," Jeff Marren, consignment director for Graceland Auctions, said on Friday.\u000a\u000aThose who attended paid $20 to bid on items spanning Presley's career on screen and stage. The auction was part of the festivities in Memphis for Elvis Week, which annually brings thousands of fans to the city to celebrate the life of Presley, who died Aug. 16, 1977, in his bathroom inside the mansion.\u000a\u000aAll the auction items were from third-party collectors and not from Graceland archives, the auctioneers said.\u000a\u000aMany items in the auction sold for more than their estimated value, said Marren, who added that the next auction will be held in January during Presley's birthday celebration.\u000a\u000aNot everything in the auction met expectations.\u000a\u000aPresley's bone-colored, three-button, no-lapel jacket from a dance scene with actress Ann-Margret in the movie \u201cViva Las Vegas\u201d was estimated to be worth $30,000 to $50,000, but did not sell after failing to attract a high enough offer.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Tim Ghianni; Editing by Ben Klayman and Will Dunham)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aLONDON Scientists have genetically modified mice to be super-intelligent and found they are also less anxious, a discovery that may help the search for treatments for disorders such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\u000a\u000aResearchers from Britain and Canada found that altering a single gene to block the phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B) enzyme, which is found in many organs including the brain, made mice cleverer and at the same time less fearful.\u000a\u000a"Our work using mice has identified phosphodiesterase-4B as a promising target for potential new treatments," said Steve Clapcote, a lecturer in pharmacology at Britain's Leeds University, who led the study.\u000a\u000aHe said his team is now working on developing drugs that will specifically inhibit PDE4B. The drugs will be tested first in animals to see whether any of them might be suitable to go forward into clinical trials in humans.\u000a\u000aIn the experiments, published on Friday in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, the scientists ran a series of behavioral tests on the PDE4B-inhibited mice and found they tended to learn faster, remember events longer and solve complex problems better than normal mice.\u000a\u000aThe "brainy" mice were better at recognizing a mouse they had seen the previous day, the researchers said, and were also quicker at learning the location of a hidden escape platform.\u000a\u000aThey were also less able to recall a fearful event after several days than ordinary mice, and as PDE4B is also found in humans, this could be of interest in the search for treatments for brain conditions as well as mental decline linked to aging.\u000a\u000aThe experiments also showed that PDE4B-inhibited mice suffered less anxiety, choosing to spend more time in open, brightly lit spaces than normal mice, which preferred dark, enclosed spaces.\u000a\u000aAnd while mice are naturally scared of cats, the modified mice responded less fearfully to cat urine, suggesting that inhibiting PDE4B could increase risk-taking behavior.\u000a\u000a(Editing by Louise Ireland)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

Mandatory Credit: Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aKOHLER, Wisconsin Dazzling sunshine and ideal scoring conditions greeted the early starters at the PGA Championship on Sunday with a final-round shootout on the cards and the prospect of further golfing glory for Jordan Spieth.\u000a\u000aMasters and U.S. Open champion Spieth heads into the final 18 holes of regulation at Whistling Straits just two shots behind overnight leader Jason Day in his bid to win a rare third major victory this year.\u000a\u000aWhile Australian Day will be a sentimental favorite for many after coming agonizingly close to landing a first major with several close calls, American Spieth has an opportunity to cap one of the greatest seasons ever.\u000a\u000aThe remarkable 22-year-old claimed the Masters in April before landing the U.S. Open in June, then tied for fourth in last month's British Open at St. Andrews -- one stroke short of joining a playoff.\u000a\u000aShould Spieth triumph at Whistling Straits, he would join Ben Hogan (1953) and Tiger Woods (2000) as the only players in the modern era to have won three majors in a single year.\u000a\u000a"I'll go into tomorrow strictly for the history piece of trying to get my name on a different major," Spieth said after storming home with six birdies in the final eight holes to shoot a seven-under 65 in Saturday's third round.\u000a\u000a"It's a goal of mine to capture all four throughout my career. I've got a great opportunity to get the third right now," added the American, who also has an opportunity on Sunday to replace Rory McIlroy as world number one.\u000a\u000aDay, who has recorded nine top-10 finishes in the majors, six of them in the top four, is set to tee off with Spieth at 1.45 p.m. local (1845 ET) in pursuit of a long-awaited first major title.\u000a\u000a"It should be an exciting round, I'm really looking forward to it," the 27-year-old Australian said after firing a 66 on Saturday to seize a two-shot lead at 15-under 201.\u000a\u000a"My confidence level is high. I've done all the hard work right now to get into contention, to have this lead. So I just need to be patient with myself, need to make sure that I stay disciplined to my targets."\u000a\u000aAlso well placed to push on for victory were English world number six Justin Rose and South African Branden Grace, both three shots off the pace, and twice major winner Martin Kaymer of Germany, at 11 under.\u000a\u000aAnother low day of scoring is in prospect on the visually spectacular links-style layout, as proved by early starter Ryan Moore who set off with five consecutive birdies and was six under for the day after 15 holes.\u000a\u000a(Editing by Justin Palmer)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

On NBC's "Meet the Press," he said he would deport all undocumented immigrants and rescind U.S. President Barack Obama's executive orders on immigration.\u000a\u000aThe orders, if enacted, could protect as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.\u000a\u000aIn a policy paper issued on Sunday, Trump said he would increase fees on temporary visas for Mexican chief executives, diplomats and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) workers if Mexico does not agree to pay for the wall.\u000a\u000aThe NAFTA agreement of 1994 eliminated most tariff and other barriers to free trade and investment between the United States, Canada and Mexico. It permits the temporary cross-border movement of business travelers within the region.\u000a\u000aTrump said he would also impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages and increase fees at ports of entry from Mexico. Foreign aid cuts and tariffs would also be considered.\u000a\u000a"The Mexican government has taken the United States to the cleaners," he said. "They are responsible for this problem, and they must help pay to clean it up."\u000a\u000aTrump began his campaign in June by saying Mexico is sending its criminals and rapists to the U.S. The comment sparked outrage from Hispanic civil rights groups and others.\u000a\u000aIn his new position paper, Trump said he would triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and pay for the increase by eliminating tax credit payments to illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aHe would also increase penalties for people who overstay their visas and end the policy of giving automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aApplicants seeking to enter the U.S. would have to certify that they could pay for their own housing, healthcare and other needs, he said, and he would raise the bar for the admission of refugees and asylum-seekers.\u000a\u000aTrump said he would also place the issuing of green cards to foreign workers on pause so employers would have to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed workers.\u000a\u000a"This will help reverse women's plummeting workplace participation rate, grow wages, and allow record immigration levels to subside to more moderate historical averages," he said.\u000a\u000aThe Presidential election will be held in 2016.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Toni Clarke in Washington, editing by Larry King)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aLimited supplies of baby poultry and barn space to house them will hamper U.S. farmers' efforts to rebuild ravaged egg supplies after the nation's worst-ever outbreak of bird flu.\u000a\u000aAs a result of the shortages and the loss of more than 48 million chickens and turkeys to the disease, egg prices will climb higher than previously expected this year and remain high through 2016, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Frozen wholesale turkey prices are expected to be up to 19 percent higher for the key Thanksgiving holiday than they were a year ago.\u000a\u000aChicken and turkey producers say the egg and poultry industry faces up to two years of rebuilding to fully replace flocks.\u000a\u000aAlmost two months have passed since the last case of flu was detected, and farmers whose flocks were wiped out are now cleaning their barns before bringing in new birds. But the USDA has yet to give the clearance that would allow any chicken sites in Iowa, the top egg-producing state, to bring in replacements.  \u000a\u000aSome farms that raise egg-laying chickens are expected to start bringing in new chickens this fall, although sites that lost millions of birds will likely remain empty until the end of the year due to the long cleanup process. The USDA clears farms on a case by case basis after testing to make sure the virus has been eliminated.\u000a\u000aAnd the rebuilding process could last even longer if the virus re-emerges this fall when wild ducks, which carry the disease, begin their seasonal migrations.\u000a\u000aMinnesota and Iowa turkey farms, infected before some of the chicken farms, have begun restocking thanks to a faster cleanup process. Unlike laying hens, turkeys are not kept in cages, but it won\u2019t be quick enough to avert sticker shock come November\u2019s holiday.\u000a\u000aTop U.S. turkey hatcher Willmar Poultry Co has told customers it expects shortages of baby turkeys needed to restock barns, said Brad Moline, an Iowa farmer and representative of the National Turkey Federation. Willmar did not respond to requests for comment.\u000a\u000aThe USDA, in a monthly supply and demand report on Aug. 12, raised its estimate for wholesale frozen turkey prices in the fourth quarter to $1.28 to $1.36 per pound, up from an average of about $1.14 a year earlier.\u000a\u000aGrocers often discount turkeys during the holidays to drive traffic in stores. However, rising wholesale prices could still sting shoppers.  "Some chains might not discount them quite as heavily," USDA agricultural economist Dave Harvey said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEGG PROMOTION CANCELED\u000a\u000aWholesale shell egg prices in the Midwest reached a record high of $2.88 a dozen in the first week of August, more than double the price a year earlier, according to commodities firm Urner Barry. More Americans are eating breakfast out, putting further upward pressure on prices.\u000a\u000aThe USDA, which uses New York wholesale egg prices as a benchmark, last week raised its forecast for 2015 and 2016, citing the tight supplies.  \u000a\u000aIn the fourth quarter of this year, the USDA sees New York wholesale egg prices averaging $2.38 to $2.52 a dozen, up about a third from its July estimate of $1.79 to $1.91.\u000a\u000aIt predicts prices next year will average $1.64 to $1.78 a dozen, up about 20 percent from its July estimate, and still above the record average high recorded in 2014 of about $1.42.\u000a\u000aPoultry breeders and hatcheries like Hy-Line International, the world's largest seller of baby chicks that grow into egg-laying hens, are already overwhelmed with orders for replacement birds from farmers desperate to resume production, according to customers.\u000a\u000a"Every egg that is out there is spoken for, as far as hatching eggs," said Steve Welch, Iowa-based sales representative for Centurion Poultry, which hatches Hy-Line eggs and delivers the chicks to egg producers.\u000a\u000aDunkin' Brands Group Inc, which franchises the Dunkin' Donuts chain and serves breakfast sandwiches with eggs, withdrew a "major promotion" for the third quarter because of tight supplies. A spokeswoman declined to provide details.\u000a\u000aMichael Foods, a unit of cereal maker Post Holdings Inc that distributes egg products, has suspended production of some items, furloughed workers and raised prices several times.\u000a\u000aOn August 7, Post Chief Executive Rob Vitale said "all of the dynamics that are in place now will continue through the bulk of calendar year 2016."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aALL EYES ON IOWA\u000a\u000aIowa-based Hy-Line, owned by Germany's EW Group, dominates up to 80 percent of the market for selling the baby birds needed to replace chickens that died, according to industry members.\u000a\u000aFarmers with orders on the books for chicks this autumn are "hanging on to those orders in hopes that they can get approval" from the USDA to restock, said Tom Jorgensen, general counsel for Hy-Line.\u000a\u000aFarmers can cancel orders about a month ahead of delivery if they do not win approval, and Hy-Line can resell the birds.\u000a\u000a"Right now this whole re-population thing is a bit of a moving target," said Jorgensen, who called the industry's market share estimates for Hy-Line "fair".\u000a\u000aHe said he could not confirm whether there would be a shortage of baby chicks.\u000a\u000aLarge egg farms typically only replace a small portion of their egg-laying hens at a time as the birds grow older and produce fewer eggs. Now, farmers want more birds than usual all at once to restart their businesses after losing entire flocks to the flu.\u000a\u000aHowever, hatcheries cannot easily ramp up production without more breeding birds and incubators.\u000a\u000a"These are not widgets," Chad Gregory, CEO of the trade group United Egg Producers, said about the birds. "You cannot just add another shift."\u000a\u000aThere is also limited barn space for raising chicks into young birds, known as pullets.\u000a\u000aOnce the USDA begins clearing Iowa farms to restock chickens, orders for replacement birds will pile up, Gregory said.\u000a\u000aRembrandt Foods, a top egg producer, is looking at ways to speed up the rebuilding process, including putting young birds into laying houses weeks earlier than usual, spokesman Jonathan Spurway said.\u000a\u000aThe move would create additional space in pullet barns to raise replacement birds while pullets finish growing in laying houses. But the birds need to be tall enough to reach feed and water systems in laying houses, making it a complicated tactic.\u000a\u000aRembrandt had two farms infected, one containing about 5 million chickens and the other about 2 million. The Iowa-based company does not expect to begin restocking them until December or January and is importing shell eggs from Europe to help fill the supply gap, Spurway said.\u000a\u000a"You can't skip the pullet-growing process," he said. "That's why the pullet growing is going to be such a bottleneck in the industry."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Jo Winterbotton and Amran Abocar)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aWASHINGTON Hey, high schoolers, scared of bombing on the SATs and not getting into college? Don't worry, a growing number of U.S. schools are scrapping standardized test scores as part of admission.\u000a\u000aWashington, D.C.'s George Washington University last month joined more than 850 U.S. colleges and universities that no longer require applicants to take the SAT or ACT, tests that have been a feature of American student life for decades.\u000a\u000aProponents of making the tests optional say the switch can help schools become more diverse and admit students who will thrive even though they may have lagged other applicants on scores.\u000a\u000a"It was really about making sure that the right students, students for whom GW would be a great place, were not discouraged from applying," said Karen Stroud Felton, George Washington's dean of admissions.\u000a\u000aThe test-optional trend has accelerated in recent years, with more than two dozen schools dropping the requirement since the spring of 2014, according to the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, which advocates for test-optional admissions. They include Wisconsin's Beloit College and Temple University in Philadelphia.\u000a\u000aBut defenders of the SAT and ACT tests of math, reading and writing say they level the playing field for applicants and provide an objective measure for scholarships.\u000a\u000aCyndie Schmeiser, chief of assessment at the College Board, the non-profit that administers the SAT, said research had repeatedly shown it was a strong predictor of academic success.\u000a\u000aThe SAT is relied upon by thousands of U.S. colleges and universities. It also gives low-income and minority students access to higher education by stripping out subjective factors such as grade inflation, she said.\u000a\u000a"The bottom line is that more knowledge is better than less, and especially information like the SAT that is captured under comparable conditions for all kids," Schmeiser said.\u000a\u000aAbout 1.7 million students took the SAT in 2014, up almost 60 percent in 20 years, and 1.8 million took the ACT, according to College Board and ACT numbers.\u000a\u000aThe United States had 3,026 four-year colleges in the 2012-13 academic year, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\u000a\u000aDROPPING THE TEST\u000a\u000aNatalie Casimir, an 18-year-old from Troutman, North Carolina, is among the college students who were helped by the new trend away from test scores.\u000a\u000aEven with a high school grade point average of 4.0, she said, her SAT score of 1580 out of 2400 had driven her to despair about getting into college. That score would have put her in the 60th percentile of students taking the SAT in 2013, the College Board said.\u000a\u000a"I didn't feel like my SAT scores adequately depicted how I perform as a student, because I did really well in the classroom," Casimir said.\u000a\u000aBut she applied to North Carolina's Wake Forest, which dropped the standardized test requirement in 2008, and got in. Now she is looking at English and political science as areas of study and sees Wake Forest as home.\u000a\u000a"I've absolutely loved it," said Casimir, now a sophomore.\u000a\u000aA 2014 study of test-optional admissions involving 123,000 students at 33 schools found no major difference in college grade point averages or graduation rates between those who submitted test scores and those who did not.\u000a\u000aGPA RULES\u000a\u000aWilliam Hiss, the study's main investigator and a former head of admissions at Bates College in Maine, said high school grade point average turns out to be an excellent indicator of college success.\u000a\u000a"The fact that they are not a great test taker is maybe the only thing that's out of whack" for strong high school students applying to college, he said.\u000a\u000aAbout 30 percent of students at the schools examined did not submit test scores. They tended to be the first in their families to go to college, minorities, women, from low-income families or recipients of federal Pell Grants, which do not have to be repaid, Hiss said.\u000a\u000aSome data raises doubts, however, about whether test-optional admissions boost minority enrollment and diversity.\u000a\u000aAn analysis for the American Educational Research Association and Sage Publications published last year showed that colleges made no progress in improving diversity after adopting test-optional policies.\u000a\u000aBut the number of applications went up after schools dropped the test requirements, which also eliminates some of the costs of applying to college. Taking the SAT or ACT can cost up to $56.50 for a U.S. student, and many applicants take the test more than once.\u000a\u000aA test-prep industry has also cropped up to coach high schoolers, with IBISWorld market research estimating annual revenue for tutoring and test prep businesses at $9 billion.\u000a\u000aThe number of test preparation companies soared to 8,777 in 2013 from just under 2,900 in 1998, the U.S. Census Bureau reported. Major test prep companies include Kaplan Inc, a unit of Graham Holdings Co, and Princeton Review, part of IAC/InterActive Corp.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Scott Malone)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aLONDON Listening to music before, during and after surgery reduces patients' pain, eases anxiety and lessens the need for painkillers, British scientists said on Thursday.\u000a\u000aAfter reviewing evidence from around 7,000 patients, the scientists said people going for surgery should be allowed to choose the music they'd like to hear to maximize the benefit.\u000a\u000aBut they also warned that the music should not interfere with the medical team's communication during an operation.\u000a\u000a"Music is a non-invasive, safe, cheap intervention that should be available to everyone undergoing surgery," said Catherine Meads from Brunel University, who co-led the research.\u000a\u000aThe team conducted a meta-analysis of all published randomized trials looking at how music compares with standard care or other non-drug interventions such as massage and relaxation in effecting recovery of adults after operations.\u000a\u000aThe results, published in The Lancet journal, found patients were significantly less anxious after surgery and reported more satisfaction after listening to music. They also needed less pain medication and reported less pain compared with controls.\u000a\u000aWhile the study found listening to music at any time seemed effective, there was a trend for better outcomes if patients listened to music before surgery rather than during or after.\u000a\u000aAnd when patients selected their own music, there was a slightly greater reduction in pain and in use of pain relief.\u000a\u000a"We have known since the time of Florence Nightingale that listening to music has a positive impact on patients during surgery, by making them feel calmer and reducing pain," said Martin Hirsch of Queen Mary University of London, who co-led the work. "However, it's taken pulling together all the small studies ... into one robust meta-analysis to really prove it works."\u000a\u000aPaul Glasziou of Australia's Bond University said the results held a clear message: "Music is a simple and cheap intervention," he wrote in a comment in The Lancet. "A drug with similar effects might generate substantial marketing."\u000a\u000aThe team now plans to follow up with a pilot scheme introducing music at The Royal London Hospital for women having Caesarean sections and women having hysteroscopy.\u000a\u000aPatients will submit their playlist on a device of their choice to be connected to a pillow with inbuilt loudspeakers, and the researchers will then analyze the effectiveness of rolling this out in practice.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aStanford team members researcher Isis Trenchard (L to R), associate professor of bioengineering Christina Smolke, chemistry graduate student Stephanie Galanie and research associate Kate Thodey are shown in this undated handout photo provided by Stanford University in...\u000aReuters/Rod Searcey/Stanford University/Handout via Reuters\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aWASHINGTON Scientists have invented a speedy method to make potent painkilling opioids using bioengineered baker's yeast instead of poppies, but need to fine-tune the process to make it commercially viable, according to a study published on Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe new method, if it can be made more efficient, could significantly change the multibillion-dollar pain medication manufacturing business, but raises concerns about aggravating the growing problem of opioid abuse.\u000a\u000aThis same type of approach potentially also could be used to make other currently plant-based medicines for fighting cancer, infectious diseases and chronic illnesses.\u000a\u000aThe scientists said they altered the yeast's genetic make-up in a way that coaxed the cells to convert sugar into two opioids - hydrocodone and thebaine - in three to five days.\u000a\u000aHydrocodone, which shuts down pain receptors in the brain, and related chemicals like morphine and oxycodone are part of a group of painkilling drugs called opioids produced from the opium poppy. Making opioids from opium poppies can take more than a year.\u000a\u000a"This is important because, with further development, it may provide an alternative supply for these essential medicines and allow greater access for most of the global population that currently has insufficient access to pain medication," said Stanford University bioengineering professor Christina Smolke, who led the research published in the journal Science.\u000a\u000aThe researchers said they recognized their findings on a quicker process to make opioids could generate concern about worsening the growing abuse of these painkillers.\u000a\u000aSmolke's team inserted DNA into the yeast that encodes instructions for the cells to make the enzymes necessary to perform the sugar conversion steps.\u000a\u000aThe baker's yeast was engineered with 23 genes from six different organisms: the brown rat, the goldthread herb, the California poppy, the Iranian poppy, the opium poppy and a soil bacterium called Pseudomonas putida.\u000a\u000aThe process unveiled by Smolke's team represents "proof of principle experiments" showing that the bioengineered yeast can produce small amounts of opioid painkillers from scratch, Smolke said. Currently, about 4,400 gallons of bioengineered yeast would be needed to yield a single dose of the medication.\u000a\u000aSmolke said the process needs to be improved to make it efficient enough for commercial production, saying this could take several years.\u000a\u000aStanford University holds the patents on the technology described by the researchers, who have formed a company to pursue the commercial applications.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Bill Rigby)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aA California automotive start-up is hoping their prototype supercar will redefine car manufacturing. The sleek race car dubbed 'Blade' didn't come off an assembly line - but out of a 3D printer.\u000a\u000aKevin Czinger of Divergent Microfactories has spent most of his career in the automotive industry. One day he realized that no matter how fuel-efficient or how few tailpipe emissions the modern car has, the business of car manufacturing is destroying the environment.\u000a\u000a"3D printing of metal radically changes that. By looking at 3D printing not for that overall structure but to create individual modular structures that can be combined, that 3D printing transforms everything," said Czinger during an interview with Reuters in Silicon Valley.\u000a\u000aAccording to Czinger, 3D printing transforms everything by changing the way the structural components of cars are fabricated. Currently cars are pieced together on long assembly lines inside large factories that use massive amounts of energy. Even the most fuel-efficient car has a large carbon footprint before ever leaving the plant.\u000a\u000aCzinger and his team's approach was to take the large plant out of the equation. To accomplish this they printed the modular pieces that are used to connect carbon rods that make up the Blade's chassis.\u000a\u000a"The 3D printed chassis is only 102 pounds and has the same strength and safety protection as a frame made out of steel," said Brad Balzer, the lead designer on the project.\u000a\u000aBy using carbon fiber instead of steel or aluminum for the body, the entire vehicle only weighs 1400 pounds (635kg), giving it twice the weight to horsepower ratio of a Bugatti Veyron.\u000a \u000aThe Blade is fitted with a 700 horse power engine that runs on natural gas, reducing its carbon footprint even further.\u000a\u000aBalzer says designing an eco-friendly speed demon supercar as their first prototype was intentional.\u000a \u000a"We focused a lot on the aesthetics of this car because it is very important to capture the people's imaginations, especially when we are talking about the core enabling technologies," he said.\u000a\u000aThe core enabling technology, the ability to print out car components that can be easily assembled, is what Kevin Czinger hopes will revolutionize car manufacturing. He says electric cars are a step in the right direction, but alone they won't be enough to curb greenhouse emissions given the projected rise in demand for cars globally unless the way they are manufactured changes.\u000a\u000a"By constructing a car this way it has less than one third of the environmental and health impact than the 85 hours all electric car for example has," he added.\u000a\u000aCzinger and Balzer are starting small but they believe their new 3D printing method for car manufacturing will have a huge impact on how the cars of the future are built.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aSALMON, Idaho Wildfires have destroyed 50 homes in north central Idaho while a fire in north-central Washington had nearly doubled in size by Sunday, fire officials said.\u000a\u000aFirefighters are also continuing to battle blazes in Oregon, Montana and the California wine region north of San Francisco, according to government officials. Dry conditions have fueled the spread the fires.\u000a\u000aThe Reach fire, sparked on Friday by lightning strikes and high winds, had doubled to 55,000 acres (22,250 hectares) by Sunday and nearly surrounded the town of Chelan, fire incident spokesman Wayne Patterson. He said the fire also had started other smaller blazes further north.\u000a\u000aAbout 1,500 people have been evacuated from the area of Chelan, a town of about 4,000.\u000a\u000aPatterson said better weather is helping to fight the blaze - the temperature was down 10 degrees Fahrenheit from the upper 90s (mid 30s Celsius) on Friday and winds were low. Power in Chelan has been restored.\u000a\u000aPatterson said there were about 727 firefighters tackling the blaze, and the National Guard would be adding more troops on Sunday night or Monday. A Blackhawk helicopter was dropping water on the fire.\u000a\u000aIn Idaho, the fast-moving Clearwater Complex fire was 15-percent contained early on Sunday after burning 50 houses and 75 outbuildings on the outskirts of the community of Kamiah.\u000a\u000aDozens of people in neighborhoods outlying the tiny logging town were told last week to flee in the face of the blazes, among more than 100 burning across the northern, southwestern and east-central parts of the state and in neighboring Oregon and Washington, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise.\u000a\u000aMore than 770 fire personnel have been assigned to fight the blazes that make up the Clearwater Complex, which has scorched almost 53,000 acres (21,500 hectares) of dense spruce forests criss-crossed by river valleys containing rural communities, Idaho fire managers said in a statement.\u000a\u000aOne of the fires in the complex was blamed last week for destroying a house and triggering the evacuation of several homes near the community of Wieppe, according to the Clearwater County Sheriff's Office.\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, residents of the unincorporated area of Greer, Idaho, were told they might have to evacuate, the sheriff's office said on its website, though it was not clear how many people would be affected.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Laura Zuckerman in Salmon, Idaho and Mary Wisniewski in Chicago; Editing by Chris Michaud and Sandra Maler)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aKOS, Greece Mohammed Ibrahim fled fighting in Afghanistan for a better life in Germany but found himself trapped in a derelict hotel on the Greek island of Kos. He has little food and water, but still hopes to find a way to leave soon.\u000a\u000a"All we do here is wait," the 18-year-old said at the abandoned Captain Elias hotel, a two-storey building with a crumbling exterior where hundreds of migrants fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Asia have found temporary refuge.\u000a\u000a"Hope is all we have. Allah willing, we will reach Germany," he said.\u000a\u000aThe student said he has friends in Germany. But few if any of the migrants who are crossing to Kos from Turkey in inflatable dinghies want to stay in Greece, a country in economic crisis.\u000a\u000aInstead, they want somehow to get to the Greek mainland, and then head north to wealthier European Union nations in the hope of finding more help or jobs.\u000a\u000aKos, just 20 km (12 miles) from the Turkish coastal town of Bodrum, has been overwhelmed in recent weeks by migrants and refugees trying to enter the EU through its shores.\u000a\u000aNearly a quarter of a million migrants have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe this year, according to the International Organization for Migration. Nearly half have come to the Greek islands, the U.N. refugee agency estimates.\u000a\u000aLocal authorities are struggling to deal with the arrivals. A passenger ferry brought to Kos to house and register migrants is giving priority to Syrians, who are treated as refugees as they are fleeing civil war.\u000a\u000aThose from other countries are often sleeping in places like the Captain Elias, which stands on the outskirts of the island's main town. There dozens of worn out mattresses are laid side by side in the lobby, where one man rests on the reception desk, covered in a bedsheet. Nearby, women dressed in headscarves watch over their toddlers as they sleep on the floor of ceramic tiles, trying to avoid broken glass strewn around.\u000a\u000aIn what used to be the hotel garden, people hang their clothes to dry between dried up palm trees. Crouched over a bucket, one man is shaving inside a makeshift tent to shelter from the scorching mid-summer sun.\u000a\u000aAs dusk falls, families light fires to cook rice and vegetables sometimes provided by medical aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). Others try to sleep huddled next to one another on cardboard boxed laid out on the terrace, covered in heaps of leaves and rubbish.\u000a\u000a"There is no electricity, no children's place, no privacy," said Murcal Rezai, a 16-year-old girl from Kabul who arrived in Kos with her sister and parents. "The situation is difficult, so many cultures living together is not easy," she said.\u000a\u000aJulia Kourafa, a doctor with MSF, said the agency was doing its best to help but lacked the resources to feed so many people. It pitched a tent for a psychologist to offer support for people there, many of whom have fled violence in their home countries, but dozens of migrants quickly turned this into another place to sleep, she said.\u000a\u000a"People are sleeping packed nearly on top of one another," she said. "These are not good conditions."\u000a\u000aOne evening in the past week, tensions flared at the hotel when two volunteers distributed food and water. Dozens jostled with one another for a bag of groceries, and Reuters reporters saw two men fighting over a bottle of water.\u000a\u000a"Captain Elias is the camp of the poor," said 22-year-old Ulan Mustafa, a Pakistani IT student who spends his days playing card games and soccer. "If Captain Elias closes, I can't imagine what we will do."\u000a\u000aHe recounts his perilous night-time journey with a group of friends to Kos across the narrow stretch of water from Turkey. His own family has no idea of his whereabouts. "They don't know if I'm dead or alive,' he said.\u000a\u000a(Writing by Karolina Tagaris; editing by David Stamp)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCast members Corey Hawkins (R), who portrays Dr. Dre, and O'Shea Jackson Jr. (L), who portrays Ice Cube, pose with producer Ice Cube at the premiere of ''Straight Outta Compton'' in Los Angeles, California August 10, 2015.\u000aReuters/Mario Anzuoni\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aLOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - "Straight Outta Compton" may take place more than two decades ago, but its themes of racial tension, poverty, and police brutality still speak to moviegoers living in a post-Ferguson world.\u000a\u000aThe biopic about rap group N.W.A. debuted to a blistering $56.1 million this weekend in 2,757 theaters, surpassing "American Pie 2" to become the biggest ever August debut for an R-rated movie. It's the kind of opening usually reserved for so-called "tentpole movies" that trade in costumed heroes and special effects, not urban violence.\u000a\u000a"The movie tapped into something in our culture and that made it more of a must-see," said Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst at BoxOffice.com.\u000a\u000aIt's debut nearly doubles "Straight Outta Compton's" budget of $29 million in a single weekend, meaning the film could be among the most profitable releases of the summer. N.W.A members Ice Cube and Dr. Dre helped produce the film about the early days of gansta rap and were integral to its marketing campaign.\u000a\u000aUniversal, the studio behind the musical biopic, has been having a year for the ages, as a steady stream of hits such as "Jurassic World," "Fifty Shades of Grey," "Pitch Perfect 2," "Furious 7," and "Minions," have pushed its grosses to record heights. Legendary Pictures co-financed "Straight Outta Compton."\u000a\u000a"Straight Outta Compton's" success overshadowed the weekend's other new release, Warner Bros.' "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." The stylish action-adventure wilted at the megaplexes, bringing in an etiolated $13.5 million from 3,638 theaters. That's a particularly rough start considering that "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." cost a sizable $75 million to produce.\u000a\u000aThe revival of the 1960s' television show had been stuck in development hell for nearly as long as N.W.A.'s members have been making records, attracting the interest of stars like Tom Cruise and George Clooney and directors like Steven Soderbergh and Quentin Tarantino at various points. The modish version that ultimately made it to screens was directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer.\u000a\u000aTime may have hurt "The Man From U.N.C.L.E's" appeal. The picture struggled to attract younger crowds unfamiliar with the original show, as 86% of the opening weekend audience was over the age of 25.\u000a\u000a"Guy Ritchie made a terrific picture, but unfortunately it didn't catch the audience this weekend," said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. distribution executive vice president. "We know the older audience doesn't come out on the first day, so hopefully they will find the movie over the next couple of weeks."\u000a\u000aIn second place, Paramount's "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation" continued to get a lift from strong word-of-mouth, picking up $17 million in its third weekend. That brings its North American haul to $138.1 million.\u000a\u000aFox's "Fantastic Four" dropped steeply in its second weekend, falling nearly 70% from its debut and mustering a paltry $8 million. The film ranks as one of the biggest comic book movie flops in history, having earned a meager $42 million stateside.\u000a\u000aSTX Entertainment's "The Gift" rounded out the top five, earning $6.5 million this weekend and pushing its domestic total to $23.6 million.\u000a\u000aIn limited release, Sundance favorite "Mistress America" debuted to $94,000 in four theaters, representing a per-screen average of $23,500. The comedy about a college freshman (Lola Kirke) who falls under the influence of a wacky Gothamite (Greta Gerwig) was directed by Noah Baumbach and was snapped up by Fox Searchlight before it even screened at the indie festival last winter.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aSAO PAULO Tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered across Brazil on Sunday to call for the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, whom they blame for a vast corruption scandal and the economy's worst slump in a quarter century.\u000a\u000aLess than a year into her tumultuous second term, the left-wing president's support has dwindled to single digits in recent polls, while two in three support calls for her impeachment.\u000a\u000aSunday's protests were the third major demonstration of the year against Rousseff. Protesters swarmed to midday marches on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach and in front of Congress in the capital Brasilia, but a more tepid buildup on social media suggested the nationwide movement may not attract the millions of marchers touted by independent organizers in past days.\u000a\u000aSupport for the protest movement remains widespread as rising unemployment and inflation presage the worst economic downturn since at least 1990. Government austerity efforts meant to keep the country's investment-grade credit rating have also turned off Rousseff's supporters and met resistance from lawmakers.\u000a\u000a"We hear all about budget cuts, but so far it's only hurting people like me," said Francisco Mosack, a retired metalworker from the humble Sao Paulo neighborhood of Capao Redondo, who complained that his electric bill had doubled in a year.\u000a\u000a"I'm coming out to show my indignation," said Mosack, 65, wearing the canary yellow jersey of Brazil's national soccer team as he joined a sea of green and yellow along Sao Paulo's midtown thoroughfare Avenida Paulista.\u000a\u000aPOOREST TURN ON PRESIDENT\u000a\u000aA Datafolha survey this month showed impeachment has the most support among the poorest and least educated Brazilians, who overwhelmingly backed Rousseff in her narrow re-election victory last October.\u000a\u000aSensing weakness, congressional leaders have sabotaged much of the president's legislative agenda. The leader of the lower house of Congress, who is responsible for moving ahead with an impeachment vote, broke entirely with her government last month.\u000a\u000aThe president had measured success this week consolidating support among restive Senate leaders for a pro-business agenda. But their alliance remains fragile.\u000a\u000aFurther muddying the waters, a bribery and money-laundering investigation at state-run oil company Petrobras has spilled into the political realm as the prosecutor-general readies charges against sitting politicians.\u000a\u000aBrazil's biggest-ever corruption scandal already landed several of the country's most prominent executives in jail, and plea deals have implicated congressional leaders and senior members of Rousseff's government.\u000a\u000aNo evidence has emerged incriminating Rousseff, but many protesters consider her responsible for wrongdoing at Petrobras, where she was chairwoman from 2003 to 2010.\u000a\u000a(Additional reporting by Anthony Boadle and Luciana Otoni in Brasilia, Roberto Samora and Eduardo Simões in Sao Paulo; Editing by Mary Milliken)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

But the former ally who beat him at the polls in January, President Maithripala Sirisena, now leads the party and he rules that out.\u000a\u000aThe tangled personal rivalry has overshadowed campaigning on the Indian Ocean island of 20 million people, which has a history of political feuding that has often spilled over into violence and even the assassination of its leaders.\u000a\u000aSirisena, in a cross-party alliance with a government led by the United National Party (UNP), has sought to break with that troubled past by passing reforms to weaken his own presidency and make the government more open and accountable.\u000a\u000a"We all united and voted against Rajapaksa to send him into retirement," Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at his last campaign stop on Friday night. "If he hasn't got the message, we should unite to make sure he understands it now."\u000a\u000aMinority Tamils and Muslims have rallied behind the centre-right coalition led by Wickremesinghe's UNP, which pundits say has the best chance of forming the largest bloc in the 225-seat parliament.\u000a\u000aA stronger UNP mandate would help complete the "unfinished business" of the reform process that has stalled because the party and its allies now lack a majority, said political analyst Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu.\u000a\u000aRajapaksa, 69, is revered as a war hero by many of Sri Lanka's Sinhala speaking Buddhist majority for crushing a 26-year Tamil uprising in 2009. Opponents accuse him of running a corrupt, brutal and dynastic regime - charges he denies.\u000a\u000a"This government chased the investors away and welcomed the underworld. In our period, we chased the underworld and brought investors," Rajapaksa has said in answer to his critics.\u000a\u000aAt stake for the wider world is whether Sri Lanka sticks to its pro-Western course or turns back towards China. Under Rajapaksa, Beijing pumped billions of dollars into making the island part of a new "Maritime Silk Route".\u000a\u000aIT'S PERSONAL\u000a\u000aSirisena quit Rajapaksa's government last year to run against him, pulling off a stunning victory in presidential elections on Jan. 8.\u000a\u000aYet he has moved only belatedly to assert his control over the SLFP and to block the path to the premiership of his erstwhile ally and party rival.\u000a\u000aIn a widely leaked letter, he accused Rajapaksa of holding the party "hostage" and ruled out naming him prime minister. Sirisena, 63, has also used his power as party leader to purge Rajapaksa loyalists from key posts in recent days.\u000a\u000aThe maneuvering could determine whether Sirisena can form a unity government comprising Wickremesinghe's centre-right alliance and his own loyalists from the SLFP, sending Rajapaksa to the opposition benches, say analysts.\u000a\u000aIn the election, 196 lawmakers will be elected from party lists in multi-member districts. The rest will be elected from national lists, with party leaders deciding who gets a ticket.\u000a\u000aFifteen million people will have the right to vote after what observers say has been an unusually clean campaign.\u000a\u000aPolls open at 7 am (0930 EDT) and close at 4 pm. The final count is due on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a(Additional reporting by Shihar Aneez and Sunil Kataria in Colombo; Writing by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Dean Yates)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aAstronomers have taken a photograph of a baby planet beyond the solar system that may reveal clues as to how planets such as Jupiter are formed and influence their planetary siblings, a study released on Thursday shows.\u000a\u000aScientists used the newly commissioned Gemini Planet Imager, which is mounted on top of a telescope in Chile, to find the planet, known as 51 Eridani b. It circles a very young sun-like star that is located about 96 light years from Earth.\u000a\u000aThe planet, which is about double the size of Jupiter, is positioned a bit farther away from its parent star than Saturn orbits the sun. 51 Eridani b is one of the smallest planets beyond the solar system to be directly imaged.\u000a\u000aStill radiating heat from its formation less than 20 million years ago, or about 40 million years after dinosaurs became extinct, 51 Eridani b is glowing in infrared light, which is how the telescope saw it.\u000a\u000a"51 Eri b provides an opportunity to study in detail a planet that is still influenced by its formation initial conditions," Stanford University astronomer Bruce Macintosh and colleagues wrote in this week's issue of the journal Science.\u000a\u000aFollow-up analysis revealed that the planet's atmosphere, like Jupiter's, is dominated by methane. The discovery provides an important clue for scientists trying to figure out how these types of gas-giant planets form and evolve.\u000a\u000a"51 Eri b is the first young planet that probably looks like Jupiter did billions of years ago, making it currently our most important cornerpiece of the planet-formation jigsaw puzzle," University of Arizona planetary scientist Travis Barman said in a statement.\u000a\u000aAstronomers have only been able to directly see a handful of planets beyond the solar system and nearly all of those have been five to 13 times as massive as Jupiter.\u000a\u000aOther telescopes, like NASA's Kepler observatory, look for planets indirectly. Kepler, for example, looked for slight dips in the amount of light coming from target stars, a possible clue that an orbiting planet was crossing the face of its parent star.\u000a\u000aAnother method is to look for wobbles in starlight that may be caused by the slight gravitational tugs of circling planets.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Irene Klotz.

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTORONTO Swiss teenager Belinda Bencic capped a fairytale run to the Rogers Cup title on Sunday when a distressed second seed Simona Halep was forced to retire from the final trailing 7-6(5) 6-7(4) 3-0.\u000a\u000aBencic needed nearly two hours and 30 minutes on a sweltering centre court to see off a determined Halep and claim the biggest title of her young career, putting down a marker as a player to watch at the U.S. Open.\u000a\u000aThe 18-year-old's Rogers Cup debut was a memorable one as Bencic's drive to the title included a stunning semi-final upset of world number one Williams and two former number ones in fourth seed Caroline Wozniacki and fifth seed Ana Ivanovic.\u000a\u000aHalep produced a gutsy effort but the Romanian appeared in trouble right from the start as she struggled with the heat and a sore left thigh that required treatment throughout the match, including a medical time out when medical staff checked her blood pressure.\u000a\u000aDown 5-3 in the second and with Bencic serving for the match, the 23-year-old dug deep into her reserves and forced the set to a tiebreak which she won to thundering applause from the sun-baked crowd.\u000a\u000aBut the effort to force a third set proved too much.\u000a\u000aTrailing 3-0, Halep went to her chair during the changeover then quickly got up and walked over to Bencic and shook hands, telling her she could not continue.\u000a \u000a(Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto.

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPaolo Ferri (R) Head of Rosetta Mission Operations, seen on a video projection behind a model of the Philae lander, reacts after the successful landing of the lander on comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko, at the European Space Agency's (ESA) headquarters in Darmstadt November...\u000aReuters/Ralph Orlowski/Files\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBERLIN/FRANKFURT European scientists have revised their plans for the comet lander Philae and are now focusing on getting images and drill samples if communications are restored.\u000a\u000aAfter coming to rest in the shadows when it landed on a comet in November, Philae woke up in June, delighting scientists from the European Space Agency, who came up with plans for several experiments they wanted to run before working up to the most risky one - drilling into the surface.\u000a\u000aBut with the 100kg washing-machine size lander having been silent for over a month now, those plans have been revised.\u000a\u000a"The problem is not power, but communications," Aurelie Moussi from space agency CNES said in a webcast on Thursday. "We have to find something to do in a shorter duration."\u000a\u000aShe said the priorities were now to get pictures from the surface and also to drill into the surface, which Philae was not able to do when it first landed in November.\u000a\u000aScientists hope that samples from the surface of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko will help show how planets and life are created as the rock and ice that make up comets preserve organic molecules like a time capsule.\u000a\u000aThe Rosetta spacecraft, which is orbiting the comet and through which communications with Philae are relayed to Earth, has spent two weeks at a different part of the comet. But since Aug. 11, it has been back in an area where it should be able to communicate with Philae.\u000a\u000aNo contact has been established though and the data from the last communications shows one of the lander's transmitters is broken. Its two receivers are also not working as they should, Barbara Cozzoni, Philae operations engineer said.\u000a\u000aThe comet on Thursday passed the closest point to the sun on its orbit, about 185 million kilometers from the sun.\u000a\u000aThe comet's activity levels have been increasing as it approaches the sun and it's now shedding up to 1,000 kg of dust and enough water to fill two bathtubs every second.\u000a\u000aWhen Rosetta first approached the comet last year, the comet was giving off only about two small glasses of water per second.\u000a\u000aScientists have also observed powerful gas jets, though Cozzoni said it was unlikely that Philae could be pushed off into space by a jet.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Victoria Bryan and Maria Sheahan; Editing by Tom Heneghan)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aATHENS Greece's socialist PASOK party joined the main opposition on Sunday in saying it would not back Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras if he calls a confidence vote following a rebellion in the governing party over a new bailout deal.\u000a\u000aTsipras had to rely on opposition groups including PASOK to win a parliamentary majority on Friday in favour of the 86 billion euro bailout programme, Greece's third with international creditors since 2010.\u000a\u000aBy contrast, Tsipras suffered the biggest rebellion yet among anti-bailout lawmakers from his leftist Syriza party, forcing him to consider a confidence vote that would pave the way for early elections if he loses.\u000a\u000aPASOK made clear that while it had backed the government over bailout for the sake of saving Greece from financial ruin, that support would not extend to any confidence vote in the coming weeks.\u000a\u000aThe party blamed Tsipras and Panos Kammenos, who leads the minority partner in the coalition government, for the fact that Greece had to take yet another bailout with tough austerity and reform conditions demanded by the euro zone and IMF.\u000a\u000a"The government has signed the third and most onerous bailout. All the negative consequences for the country and its citizens bear the signatures of Mr Tsipras and Mr Kammenos," the party said in a statement. "We have no confidence in the Tsipras-Kammenos government and of course will not give it if we are asked."\u000a\u000aPASOK, once the dominant force on the Greek left, now has just 13 members in the 300 seat parliament but Tsipras may need all the support he can get. Crucially, it did not say whether it would vote against the government, or merely abstain.\u000a\u000aOn Friday, support for the government from within its own coalition parties fell below 120 votes, the minimum needed to survive a confidence vote if some others abstain.\u000a\u000aThe main conservative opposition party, New Democracy, has also said it would not back the government, which won power in January on promises to reverse austerity policies. Tsipras was forced to back down to secure the new deal.\u000a\u000aOpinion polls show Tsipras remains popular, even though he presided over the closure of banks for three weeks, the imposition of capital controls and a near brush with financial collapse. This has raised doubts about how much the opposition parties may want to force new elections.\u000a\u000aA government official said earlier on Sunday that until Greece had secured the new funding, it would focus solely on the technicalities which need to be wrapped up.\u000a\u000aThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tsipras would hold meetings with government officials after Aug. 20, when a 3.2 billion euro debt payment to the European Central Bank falls due, "in order to determine further moves".\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Karolina Tagaris; editing by David Stamp)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aA man suspected of murder, taking three hostages and shooting two deputies in central California late last month was killed by law enforcement officers after a manhunt in remote, rugged terrain, officials said on Sunday.\u000a\u000aTwo deputy sheriffs confronted Benjamin Peter Ashley, 34, on a dirt road in the early evening on Saturday after the owner of convenience store reported that a man fitting Ashley\u2019s description had bought some food, Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood said on Sunday.\u000a\u000aTwo deputies found Ashley walking about a half mile from the store and ordered him to show his hands, Youngblood said. Ashley pulled out a handgun and the deputies fired, Youngblood said.\u000a\u000aAshley was fatally wounded, and may have been hit by his own gunfire as well as that from the deputies, Youngblood said. Three other guns were found on his body.\u000a\u000aAshley is believed to have been hiding in the woods along the Pacific Crest Trail and was probably headed back to the trail, Youngblood said. The search for Ashley over a 100-square- mile area of high desert terrain east of Bakersfield, California involved state, county and federal officers, some in aircraft, and the public had been warned to be on guard, Youngblood said.\u000a\u000a"There\u2019s a lot of relief," Youngblood said. "We were spending an enormous amount of money trying to capture this guy before he killed again."\u000a\u000aAshley was suspected of killing retired dentist David Markiewitz, 64, found dead on July 30 in a cabin in the woods in Kern County, Youngblood said.  Two days earlier, Ashley briefly took three men hostage in another cabin before they got away, police said. They had confronted him and told him to leave.\u000a\u000aOn Aug. 1, Ashley shot two Kern County SWAT team deputies who found him hiding in the woods, Youngblood said. One of the deputies suffered serious injuries.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Kevin Murphy in Kansas City, Missouri; editing by Larry King)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
