Forensic archaeologists on Friday began excavating a highway embankment in eastern Pennsylvania, looking for more bones believed to be from impoverished victims of the worldwide Spanish flu pandemic in 1918.\u000a\u000aThe state highway department, known as PennDOT, received reports of bones in what appeared to be an impromptu burial site beneath a broad meadow that had once been the site of a poorhouse, said Bob Rescorla, a PennDOT inspector at the site.\u000a\u000a"There were rumors it was a mass grave here," Rescorla said of the burial ground along State Highway 61 in Schuylkill Haven, about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia.\u000a\u000aHistorians say the Spanish flu pandemic touched all parts of the world and claimed tens of millions of lives. The flu could kill quickly, sometimes in less than a day.\u000a\u000aIn Schuylkill County, the Pottsville Republican-Herald newspaper reported that some 17,000 residents were sickened and several thousand died during the pandemic, leaving as many as 3,000 children orphaned.\u000a\u000aPennDOT workers had shaved the embankment for a road widening project earlier in the week, Rescorla said, and heavy rains later caused part of the cut to collapse, exposing bones.\u000a\u000aKevin Mock, an archaeologist with PennDOT, told Reuters on Friday he could see leg bones and part of a jaw bone protruding from the embankment. He said there were no coffins.\u000a\u000aHis research found the connection of the meadow to the Spanish flu pandemic.\u000a\u000aMost victims, Mock said, were buried without coffins. He thought it unlikely there could still be active H1N1 flu pathogens - the strain that caused the 1918 pandemic - in the bones or soil given the passage of time and the usual practice of sprinkling lye over buried without coffins.\u000a\u000aA team of professors and students from Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, arrived at the site on Friday afternoon along with the Schuylkill County Coroner's Office and cadaver dogs.\u000a\u000aThe Mercyhurst team set up a sieve for screening soil for bone fragments, and marked visible bone fragments protruding from the embankment with small red flags.\u000a\u000aDr. David Moylan, the Schuylkill County coroner, said the team would not excavate the entire field, but will remove remains near the highway. They will be taken to Mercyhurst University for medical examination and possible DNA extraction.\u000a\u000aAfter that, Moylan said, they will be cremated and buried in a modern cemetery for the unidentified or unclaimed maintained by the county.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by David DeKok; Editing by Eric M.

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aLONDON Scientists have genetically modified mice to be super-intelligent and found they are also less anxious, a discovery that may help the search for treatments for disorders such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\u000a\u000aResearchers from Britain and Canada found that altering a single gene to block the phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B) enzyme, which is found in many organs including the brain, made mice cleverer and at the same time less fearful.\u000a\u000a"Our work using mice has identified phosphodiesterase-4B as a promising target for potential new treatments," said Steve Clapcote, a lecturer in pharmacology at Britain's Leeds University, who led the study.\u000a\u000aHe said his team is now working on developing drugs that will specifically inhibit PDE4B. The drugs will be tested first in animals to see whether any of them might be suitable to go forward into clinical trials in humans.\u000a\u000aIn the experiments, published on Friday in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, the scientists ran a series of behavioral tests on the PDE4B-inhibited mice and found they tended to learn faster, remember events longer and solve complex problems better than normal mice.\u000a\u000aThe "brainy" mice were better at recognizing a mouse they had seen the previous day, the researchers said, and were also quicker at learning the location of a hidden escape platform.\u000a\u000aThey were also less able to recall a fearful event after several days than ordinary mice, and as PDE4B is also found in humans, this could be of interest in the search for treatments for brain conditions as well as mental decline linked to aging.\u000a\u000aThe experiments also showed that PDE4B-inhibited mice suffered less anxiety, choosing to spend more time in open, brightly lit spaces than normal mice, which preferred dark, enclosed spaces.\u000a\u000aAnd while mice are naturally scared of cats, the modified mice responded less fearfully to cat urine, suggesting that inhibiting PDE4B could increase risk-taking behavior.\u000a\u000a(Editing by Louise Ireland)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

It has slowed planting and left one in 10 residents waiting for government tank trucks to survive in record summer heat.\u000a\u000aThe country's civil defense system said the drought, record heat and water leakage have led to "low levels of available water for the population, agriculture, industry and services."\u000a\u000aThe government has not provided a national breakdown of drought damage but it said on Monday that emergency measures were being taken at all levels, including stricter rationing of water through the state-run waterworks.\u000a\u000aCommunist-run Cuba loses around 50 percent of the water pumped from its reservoirs due to leaks. There is little irrigation of farm land and the systems that exist are outdated and inefficient.\u000a\u000aDrought conditions across the Caribbean, caused by the phenomenon known as El Nino, have left reservoirs at 37 percent of capacity.\u000a\u000aCuban authorities appear increasingly alarmed by the situation, which could lead to wider rationing in major cities and hard choices on where water should be allocated with winter planting, the tourism season and sugar milling all beginning in November.\u000a\u000a"The drought is everyone's problem and so every state entity has to ... create a plan immediately," Chapman Waught, who heads Cuba's waterworks, said last week as she toured the country.\u000a\u000aThis year's rainy season, which includes the hurricane season, is forecast to bring rains well below the norm due to El Nino.\u000a\u000aIt has been seven years since a hurricane, which on average hits Cuba every other year, has swept along the island, dumping much-needed torrential rains along with inevitable damage.\u000a\u000aHurricane Sandy cut a narrow path across parts of eastern Cuba in 2012.\u000a\u000a"It is hard to believe, but many of us are hoping for a hurricane," said Nuris Lopez, a hairdresser in eastern Granma province where residents receive a bit of water once a week and otherwise rely on tanker trucks.\u000a\u000a"I might lose my roof, but at least I could clean my house," she said.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Marc Frank; Editing by Dan Grebler)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) member and pole vault legend Sergey Bubka of Ukraine, arrives at the Juan Santamaria international airport in Alajuela August 5, 2015.\u000aReuters/Juan Carlos Ulate\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aBEIJING Former Olympic champion Sergey Bubka thinks the fight against doping is the main task facing whoever triumphs in Wednesday's IAAF presidential election, a vote he is still confident he will win.\u000a\u000aFlanked by fellow Ukrainian sporting greats in footballer Andriy Shevchenko and boxer Vitali Klitschko, Bubka defended his sport's record in the battle against drug cheats but said clearly more needed to be done.\u000a\u000aBubka will take on another former great of the sport in Britain's Sebastian Coe in Wednesday's ballot, which has been overshadowed by allegations of wholesale doping in athletics over the last three weeks.\u000a\u000aThe six-times world champion said that far from being negligent when faced with evidence of doping, the International Association of Athletics Federation had, in fact, led the way in the fight.\u000a\u000a"We were first with biological athlete passports, we try to use scientific knowledge. We invest more than any other federation and we will continue," he told Reuters in Beijing.\u000a\u000a"We are in favor of life bans, four-year bans, and this we will continue to do. But we must do it according to the regulations. If we need to strengthen them, we will strengthen them."\u000a\u000aWhile Coe is committed to moving towards a fully independent anti-doping agency to deal with violations in international athletics, Bubka said he would work with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to chart the best way forward.\u000a\u000a"WADA play this role and invest a lot of money. We need to assess, we need to consult. One of the main subjects for the IAAF is which way we go," he said.\u000a\u000a"Which system is more efficient and more successful.\u000a\u000a"This is very important and the main task of the future IAAF president," he added.\u000a\u000aThe 51-year-old made his comments at a lunch to announce a new event for next year set up by French pole vaulter Renaud Lavillenie in his home town of Clermont-Ferrand.\u000a\u000aBubka said the event echoed work he had done in Ukraine when he was active to bring athletics to the people, which would be a key part of his strategy to popularize the sport if he was elected.\u000a\u000a"Today we can approach (people) on the square, on the street, indoor, with music," he said.\u000a\u000a"It must be spectacular, it must be a show. And in this way to attract the youth, to bring them to sport. To encourage them to be with us."\u000a\u000aSome media reports have suggested that Bubka is seriously lagging behind Coe in the support of the more than 200 national federations who will elect the new president.\u000a\u000aBubka pointed out that some federations had already broken with announcements for Coe made by blocs of nations they were part of and would put his trust in Wednesday's ballot.\u000a\u000a"For me, it's more important when it is a real vote. This is guessing, this is games. Normally I prefer a fair game, like in sport," he said.\u000a\u000a"I feel very well, I am very confident. I feel very strong, I have big support from members of our federations and I'm confident for 19th of August."\u000a\u000a(Editing by Sudipto Ganguly)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

He signed an autograph on way in and fist-bumped a supporter before heading into the courthouse.\u000a\u000aThe real estate mogul's service came after a state judge in March fined him $250 for failing to respond to summonses to serve jury duty five times since 2006.\u000a\u000aTrump's representatives say the fine was ultimately waived and say the prior summonses had been sent to a wrong address for the former star of NBC's "The Apprentice."\u000a\u000aMichael Cohen, an executive vice president and special counsel to the Trump Organization, said if Trump had received the notices, he would have complied.\u000a\u000a"Any assertion that Mr. Trump doesn't take his civic responsibilities seriously is absolutely false and only being used as an attempt to discredit his stellar reputation," he said in a statement.\u000a\u000aTrump joins a long list of celebrities to report for jury duty in the New York courts in recent years, following Madonna, Caroline Kennedy and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\u000a\u000aOutside of New York, former President George W.

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aLONDON Listening to music before, during and after surgery reduces patients' pain, eases anxiety and lessens the need for painkillers, British scientists said on Thursday.\u000a\u000aAfter reviewing evidence from around 7,000 patients, the scientists said people going for surgery should be allowed to choose the music they'd like to hear to maximize the benefit.\u000a\u000aBut they also warned that the music should not interfere with the medical team's communication during an operation.\u000a\u000a"Music is a non-invasive, safe, cheap intervention that should be available to everyone undergoing surgery," said Catherine Meads from Brunel University, who co-led the research.\u000a\u000aThe team conducted a meta-analysis of all published randomized trials looking at how music compares with standard care or other non-drug interventions such as massage and relaxation in effecting recovery of adults after operations.\u000a\u000aThe results, published in The Lancet journal, found patients were significantly less anxious after surgery and reported more satisfaction after listening to music. They also needed less pain medication and reported less pain compared with controls.\u000a\u000aWhile the study found listening to music at any time seemed effective, there was a trend for better outcomes if patients listened to music before surgery rather than during or after.\u000a\u000aAnd when patients selected their own music, there was a slightly greater reduction in pain and in use of pain relief.\u000a\u000a"We have known since the time of Florence Nightingale that listening to music has a positive impact on patients during surgery, by making them feel calmer and reducing pain," said Martin Hirsch of Queen Mary University of London, who co-led the work. "However, it's taken pulling together all the small studies ... into one robust meta-analysis to really prove it works."\u000a\u000aPaul Glasziou of Australia's Bond University said the results held a clear message: "Music is a simple and cheap intervention," he wrote in a comment in The Lancet. "A drug with similar effects might generate substantial marketing."\u000a\u000aThe team now plans to follow up with a pilot scheme introducing music at The Royal London Hospital for women having Caesarean sections and women having hysteroscopy.\u000a\u000aPatients will submit their playlist on a device of their choice to be connected to a pillow with inbuilt loudspeakers, and the researchers will then analyze the effectiveness of rolling this out in practice.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

The White House announced a new strategy on Monday to tackle the explosion in heroin use in a collection of eastern states, focusing on treating addicts rather than punishing them and targeting high-level suppliers for arrest.\u000a\u000aThe move is a response to a sharp rise in the use of heroin and opiate-based painkillers, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has described as an epidemic.\u000a\u000aHeroin use has more than doubled among people aged 18-25 in the United States in the past decade, according to CDC figures, while overdose death rates have nearly quadrupled. An estimated 45 percent of U.S. heroin users are also addicted to prescription painkillers.\u000a\u000aAnnouncing the 'Heroin Response Strategy' on Monday, Michael Botticelli, Director of National Drug Control Policy, said the new plan will address the heroin and painkiller epidemics as both "a public health and a public safety issue."\u000a\u000aUnder the plan, $2.5 million of $13.4 million in new funding to combat drug trafficking will target regions the White House said are facing a severe heroin threat: Appalachia, New England, New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration will work with local law enforcement to increase access to treatment for addicts and try to trace the sources of heroin trafficking.\u000a\u000aThe policy is in line with new criminal justice strategies that seek to treat more drug offenders as addicts within the public health system rather than as criminals who must serve long sentences in jail.\u000a\u000aRepublican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Democrat Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island have pushed for such policies for more than a year in Congress.\u000a\u000a(Reporting By Julia Edwards; Editing by Bill Rigby)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOur top photos from the last 24 hours.   Slideshow \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

Making opioids from opium poppies can take more than a year.\u000a\u000a"This is important because, with further development, it may provide an alternative supply for these essential medicines and allow greater access for most of the global population that currently has insufficient access to pain medication," said Stanford University bioengineering professor Christina Smolke, who led the research published in the journal Science.\u000a\u000aThe researchers said they recognized their findings on a quicker process to make opioids could generate concern about worsening the growing abuse of these painkillers.\u000a\u000aSmolke's team inserted DNA into the yeast that encodes instructions for the cells to make the enzymes necessary to perform the sugar conversion steps.\u000a\u000aThe baker's yeast was engineered with 23 genes from six different organisms: the brown rat, the goldthread herb, the California poppy, the Iranian poppy, the opium poppy and a soil bacterium called Pseudomonas putida.\u000a\u000aThe process unveiled by Smolke's team represents "proof of principle experiments" showing that the bioengineered yeast can produce small amounts of opioid painkillers from scratch, Smolke said. Currently, about 4,400 gallons of bioengineered yeast would be needed to yield a single dose of the medication.\u000a\u000aSmolke said the process needs to be improved to make it efficient enough for commercial production, saying this could take several years.\u000a\u000aStanford University holds the patents on the technology described by the researchers, who have formed a company to pursue the commercial applications.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Bill Rigby)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

It's the kind of opening usually reserved for so-called "tentpole movies" that trade in costumed heroes and special effects, not urban violence.\u000a\u000a"The movie tapped into something in our culture and that made it more of a must-see," said Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst at BoxOffice.com.\u000a\u000aIt's debut nearly doubles "Straight Outta Compton's" budget of $29 million in a single weekend, meaning the film could be among the most profitable releases of the summer. N.W.A members Ice Cube and Dr. Dre helped produce the film about the early days of gansta rap and were integral to its marketing campaign.\u000a\u000aUniversal, the studio behind the musical biopic, has been having a year for the ages, as a steady stream of hits such as "Jurassic World," "Fifty Shades of Grey," "Pitch Perfect 2," "Furious 7," and "Minions," have pushed its grosses to record heights. Legendary Pictures co-financed "Straight Outta Compton."\u000a\u000a"Straight Outta Compton's" success overshadowed the weekend's other new release, Warner Bros.' "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." The stylish action-adventure wilted at the megaplexes, bringing in an etiolated $13.5 million from 3,638 theaters. That's a particularly rough start considering that "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." cost a sizable $75 million to produce.\u000a\u000aThe revival of the 1960s' television show had been stuck in development hell for nearly as long as N.W.A.'s members have been making records, attracting the interest of stars like Tom Cruise and George Clooney and directors like Steven Soderbergh and Quentin Tarantino at various points. The modish version that ultimately made it to screens was directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer.\u000a\u000aTime may have hurt "The Man From U.N.C.L.E's" appeal. The picture struggled to attract younger crowds unfamiliar with the original show, as 86% of the opening weekend audience was over the age of 25.\u000a\u000a"Guy Ritchie made a terrific picture, but unfortunately it didn't catch the audience this weekend," said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. distribution executive vice president. "We know the older audience doesn't come out on the first day, so hopefully they will find the movie over the next couple of weeks."\u000a\u000aUniversal domestic distribution chief Nick Carpou labeled "Straight Outta Compton" as a "labor of love" that benefited from being dramatically different from the kind of films flooding cinemas in recent months.\u000a\u000a"The public was ready for something with a bit more substance that they could identify with," he said.\u000a\u000aThe film's opening weekend crowd was 52% female, 51% under the age of 30, 46% African American, 23% Caucasian, 21% Hispanic, and 4% Asian. It did not play in Imax or 3D, but did score in premium large format locations, grossing $5.1 million, which represented 9% of the film's weekend receipts.\u000a\u000aIn second place, Paramount's "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation" continued to get a lift from strong word-of-mouth, picking up $17 million in its third weekend. That brings its North American haul to $138.1 million.\u000a\u000aFox's "Fantastic Four" dropped steeply in its second weekend, falling nearly 70% from its debut and mustering a paltry $8 million. The film ranks as one of the biggest comic book movie flops in history, having earned a meager $42 million stateside.\u000a\u000aSTX Entertainment's "The Gift" rounded out the top five, earning $6.5 million this weekend and pushing its domestic total to $23.6 million.\u000a\u000aIn limited release, Sundance favorite "Mistress America" debuted to $94,000 in four theaters, representing a per-screen average of $23,500. The comedy about a college freshman (Lola Kirke) who falls under the influence of a wacky Gothamite (Greta Gerwig) was directed by Noah Baumbach and was snapped up by Fox Searchlight before it even screened at the indie festival last winter.\u000a\u000aFinal numbers are still being tallied, but it looks as though "Straight Outta Compton" will bolster ticket sales over the year-ago period when "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and "Guardians of the Galaxy" were drawing the biggest crowds.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCast members Corey Hawkins (R), who portrays Dr. Dre, and O'Shea Jackson Jr. (L), who portrays Ice Cube, pose with producer Ice Cube at the premiere of ''Straight Outta Compton'' in Los Angeles, California August 10, 2015.\u000aReuters/Mario Anzuoni\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aFormer National Football League players who oppose the league's settlement of lawsuits claiming it hid the risk of concussions on Monday asked a federal appeals court to throw out the comprehensive accord with more than 5,000 retirees.\u000a\u000aIn a filing with the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, 10 retired players said the accord, potentially worth $1 billion, was unfair because it excluded players who have yet to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative condition linked to repeated blows to the head.\u000a\u000aThese players said the settlement unfairly favored currently injured retirees over those merely exposed to head trauma, and left a potential 19,000 players who could face but have yet to be diagnosed with neurological diseases without a remedy.\u000a\u000a"It is the height of hypocrisy for the parties to defend a settlement that offers nothing for CTE to the vast majority of class members by arguing that those claims could not prevail at trial because the science is too new," a lawyer for the objecting players said.\u000a\u000aThe settlement, approved on April 22 by U.S. District Judge Anita Brody in Philadelphia, provides payments of up to $5 million to players who suffer from serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma.\u000a\u000aMany players opted out of the settlement. Monday's objectors said "no settlement at all" was preferable to one that provides nothing for the "vast majority" of former players, who "will probably die with evidence of CTE in their brains."\u000a\u000aNeither the NFL nor lawyers for the settling players immediately responded to requests for comment. They have until Sept. 15 to respond to the objections. There is no timetable for the appeals court to hear oral arguments or issue a decision.\u000a\u000aThe objecting players included in Monday's filing are Vincent Clark, Judson Flint, Robert Jackson, Ken Jones, Cleo Miller, Lou Piccone, Jim Rourke, Fred Smerlas, Elmer Underwood and J.

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLassina Zerbo, head of the organisation preparing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), talks during an interview with Reuters in Vienna, Austria, August 17, 2015.\u000aReuters/Heinz-Peter Bader\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aVIENNA The head of the body trying to secure ratification of a global ban on nuclear testing urged world leaders on Monday to use the momentum of an atomic deal with Iran to prevent a slide toward a nuclear weapons free-for-all.\u000a\u000aMore than 160 countries have ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) since it was finished in 1996. But since then, India, Pakistan and North Korea have all conducted nuclear tests, and are among eight countries including the United States and China blocking its entry into force.\u000a\u000aLassina Zerbo said the near two-year diplomatic marathon that agreed curbs on Iran's nuclear program, featuring all five of the U.N. Security Council's veto-wielding nuclear powers, showed what could be done with enough effort.\u000a\u000a"I think it's about time that they used a similar model of discussion like what happened in the Iran deal to reflect on the future of the CTBT - if any," said Zerbo, whose CTBT Organization is holding a conference next month to try to encourage ratification.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with Reuters, the trained scientist from Burkina Faso said the frustration of many non-nuclear weapons states had grown since a conference on boosting compliance with the landmark 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) failed to produce a joint document in May.\u000a\u000a"(If) after the NPT issue ... we're not helping the CTBT ... we might go back to a system where there's no framework for arms control and non-proliferation and disarmament. And that's a risk."\u000a\u000aU.S. President Barack Obama, who came to office promising to work to rid the world of nuclear weapons, has said he wants to push for ratification of the CTBT, but has not managed to get sufficient support among U.S. lawmakers.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the United States and Russia, which together hold more than 90 percent of the world's nuclear arsenal, have produced no plan yet for a successor to their 2009 disarmament treaty, which expires in three years' time.\u000a\u000aThe CTBT's global tracking network was the first to detect North Korea's latest nuclear test in 2013, and ratification would give its inspectors access to countries for verification.\u000a\u000aIran is another country that has failed to ratify the CTBT, along with its regional rival Israel - widely presumed to have an undeclared nuclear arsenal - and Egypt, which Western diplomats accused of scuppering the NPT conference with attempts to put the spotlight on Israel.\u000a\u000aBut there are other obstacles facing the CTBT conference.\u000a\u000aSome countries are lobbying to close what they say is a loophole, arguing that, by allowing certain non-nuclear explosions, the pact lets countries improve their atomic weapons technology.\u000a\u000aThe five official nuclear weapons states - the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France - say they need so-called subcritical tests, in which no fissile material is used, to maintain and ensure the safety of their atomic arsenals.\u000a\u000a(Editing by Kevin Liffey)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

Two-thirds of them want Rousseff's impeachment, polls show.\u000a\u000aBut rather than any radical shift in a country now in its 13th year of rule by the leftist Workers' Party, what many expect is a deep and protracted slog.\u000a\u000a"There may be lots of people on the street, but that's not likely to change much," says Esther Solano, a sociologist who has studied Brazil's protests and growing discontent with its political class. "For real change you need new ideas and new leaders and that is totally absent."\u000a\u000aThe outcomes Rousseff's fiercest critics hope for \u2013 impeachment or resignation \u2013 appear distant, if not impossible.\u000a\u000aThe auditor reviewing accounting tricks in last year's budget recently gave her more time to explain the maneuvers.\u000a\u000aAnd no criminal evidence as yet implicates Rousseff in the corruption probe around state-run energy company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, even if she chaired the company when much of the fraud occurred.\u000a\u000aFew legal grounds, then, exist to impel a complex impeachment procedure.\u000a\u000aRousseff is undeterred by single-digit approval ratings, the worst for any president during Brazil's three decades of democracy, saying repeatedly she will not step down.\u000a\u000aCROSS PURPOSES\u000a\u000aOne way out of the morass would be to steer Brazil's economy toward recovery. But Rousseff is finding little legislative support for much-needed economic reforms or an austerity package meant to curb public spending as opponents and erstwhile allies leverage her weakness to pursue their own ends.\u000a\u000aThough Congress is controlled by the Brazil Democratic Movement Party, an ostensible ally of the government known as the PMDB, the party is ideologically amorphous and its members often work at cross purposes.\u000a\u000aAfter the head of the Senate last week unveiled a raft of proposals meant to support Rousseff's austerity drive, his PMDB brethren in the lower house said not so fast.\u000a\u000a"The system is bicameral," said Eduardo Cunha, a PMDB populist and avowed obstructionist who heads the lower chamber.\u000a\u000aThe opposition is as splintered as it is dissatisfied.\u000a\u000aThe Brazilian Social Democracy Party, or PSDB, the centrist party that came close to unseating Rousseff when she clinched a second term last year, has failed to speak with a unified voice on issues ranging from impeachment to its strategy for the next elections.\u000a\u000aEfforts by the party to align itself more closely with Sunday's protests did not fuel any noticeable spike in participation or resonance with voters.\u000a\u000a"Voters are having a hard time relating to any of the parties," says Rafael Cortez, a political analyst at Tendencias, a consulting firm in Sao Paulo. "They are all talking past one another."\u000a\u000aThough the recent protests are tepid compared with massive demonstrations in 2013, when Brazilians blasted public spending on the World Cup soccer tournament just as the economy was slowing, they are consistent with a prevailing sense of disgust.\u000a\u000aUsing social media, coordinated text message campaigns and word of mouth, grassroots groups with names like "Revolted" and "Free Brazil" are channeling the frustration more effectively than established political parties.\u000a\u000a"Vem Pra Rua," or "Come to the Street," the group led by Chequer, a former financier turned communications executive, blared speeches from beneath a giant yellow balloon it hoisted for a march along the Rio de Janeiro shoreline on Sunday.\u000a\u000aFollowers chanted for Rousseff\u2019s ouster and decried corruption and the stagnation in Congress.\u000a\u000a"There is no consensus in the parties or in the government," Chequer says. "But the politicians must know that there is consensus on the street."\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Paulo Prada; Editing by Kieran Murray)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

It circles a very young sun-like star that is located about 96 light years from Earth.\u000a\u000aThe planet, which is about double the size of Jupiter, is positioned a bit farther away from its parent star than Saturn orbits the sun. 51 Eridani b is one of the smallest planets beyond the solar system to be directly imaged.\u000a\u000aStill radiating heat from its formation less than 20 million years ago, or about 40 million years after dinosaurs became extinct, 51 Eridani b is glowing in infrared light, which is how the telescope saw it.\u000a\u000a"51 Eri b provides an opportunity to study in detail a planet that is still influenced by its formation initial conditions," Stanford University astronomer Bruce Macintosh and colleagues wrote in this week's issue of the journal Science.\u000a\u000aFollow-up analysis revealed that the planet's atmosphere, like Jupiter's, is dominated by methane.

V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPaolo Ferri (R) Head of Rosetta Mission Operations, seen on a video projection behind a model of the Philae lander, reacts after the successful landing of the lander on comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko, at the European Space Agency's (ESA) headquarters in Darmstadt November...\u000aReuters/Ralph Orlowski/Files\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBERLIN/FRANKFURT European scientists have revised their plans for the comet lander Philae and are now focusing on getting images and drill samples if communications are restored.\u000a\u000aAfter coming to rest in the shadows when it landed on a comet in November, Philae woke up in June, delighting scientists from the European Space Agency, who came up with plans for several experiments they wanted to run before working up to the most risky one - drilling into the surface.\u000a\u000aBut with the 100kg washing-machine size lander having been silent for over a month now, those plans have been revised.\u000a\u000a"The problem is not power, but communications," Aurelie Moussi from space agency CNES said in a webcast on Thursday. "We have to find something to do in a shorter duration."\u000a\u000aShe said the priorities were now to get pictures from the surface and also to drill into the surface, which Philae was not able to do when it first landed in November.\u000a\u000aScientists hope that samples from the surface of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko will help show how planets and life are created as the rock and ice that make up comets preserve organic molecules like a time capsule.\u000a\u000aThe Rosetta spacecraft, which is orbiting the comet and through which communications with Philae are relayed to Earth, has spent two weeks at a different part of the comet. But since Aug. 11, it has been back in an area where it should be able to communicate with Philae.\u000a\u000aNo contact has been established though and the data from the last communications shows one of the lander's transmitters is broken. Its two receivers are also not working as they should, Barbara Cozzoni, Philae operations engineer said.\u000a\u000aThe comet on Thursday passed the closest point to the sun on its orbit, about 185 million kilometers from the sun.\u000a\u000aThe comet's activity levels have been increasing as it approaches the sun and it's now shedding up to 1,000 kg of dust and enough water to fill two bathtubs every second.\u000a\u000aWhen Rosetta first approached the comet last year, the comet was giving off only about two small glasses of water per second.\u000a\u000aScientists have also observed powerful gas jets, though Cozzoni said it was unlikely that Philae could be pushed off into space by a jet.\u000a\u000a(Reporting by Victoria Bryan and Maria Sheahan; Editing by Tom Heneghan)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
